# The start of Solar_Tiger's calculator

## This Calculator will:

### Do basic operations:

- Add
- Subtract
- Multiply
- Divide

### Perform special operations:

- Add floating point numbers (ex. 12. 3 + 7.6)
- Get percentages of numbers (ex. 10% of 10 is 1)
- Get the remainder when you divide (ex. 5 /3 = 2)

And just about whatever else I plan...
