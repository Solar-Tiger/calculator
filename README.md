# The start of Solar_Tiger's calculator

## This Calculator will:

### Do basic operations:

- Add
- Subtract
- Multiply
- Divide

### Perform special operations:

- Handle floating point numbers/decimal numbers (ex. 12. 3 + 7.6)
- Get percentages of numbers (ex. 10% of 10 is 0.1)
- Convert current number to positive or negative
- Get the square root of current number (ex. square root of 3 is 1.7320508)

And just about whatever else I plan...
